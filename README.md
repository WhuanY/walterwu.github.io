## About Me
* **Controversal yet complementary myself:**: In my life, I am a careful planner for my goals, yet venturists facing uncertainty. In conversation, I am careful listener for the speaker, yet good storyteller when engaging is needed. At work, I am a analytical profession for demanding tasks, yet imaginative innovators when creative solutions are called for. 

* **Formal Introduction of myself:**Hello! I am Wu Yuhuan. You can call me by my preferred name Walter. I study in School of IRM(Information Resource Management) in Renmin University of China. However I am discovering new possiblities in HKU as an exchange student!

* **How "myself" come into being:**
I was born in raised in Quanzhou. With my parents' professional stories in logistics and telecom industry, I witnessed a huge interest in business and information technology. Kicking out my academic journey in Information Management, I have been exploring how to be an data-driven-solution-maker in my future career life.
